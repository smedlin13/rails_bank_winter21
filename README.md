Cryptography


Cyber Security
  - making sure our user's information is safe.











  "my password"

  "$2a$12$K0ByB.6YI2/OYrB4fQOYLe6Tv0datUVf6VZ/2Jzwm879BW5K1cHey"












  Hashing
    - takes in your password
    - throws it into a hashing algorithm
      - caesar cipher
      - 32 bit
      - 64 bit
        bit are strentghs of the hashing in terms of character 
        sets it uses
    - digital fingerprint












    Caesar Cipher
   
    Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

             DOG
             ALD













def caesar_cipher(password)
  @password = password
  .
  .
  .
  10.times do
    caesar_cipher(@password)
  end
end





- not reversible






store the hash and checks anothers hashes of the real password

"$2a$12$K0ByB.6YI2/OYrB4fQOYLe6Tv0datUVf6VZ/2Jzwm879BW5K1cHey".password
- password


















Salt

adds a small data before it is hashed


password: 'p@ssword'
salt: smallData

hash(salt + "aadvark") => <really unique gibberish>
